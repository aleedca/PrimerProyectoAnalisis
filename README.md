#### Introduction
As the technology evolves and software and computers become more common in every area of the present world a very important aspect is to be considered: Efficiency. This world is ruled by efficiency, in both time and resources. As any other product on the market, software is also ruled by this principle; in this case, the resources that are needed to be focus on are time and memory.

In this project two algorithms will be studied, the K-means Unsupervised Algorithm and Decision Tree Supervised Algorithm; mainly focused on their performance. Both of them are Machine Learning algorithms implemented in completely different ways and purposes. This investigation aims to answer this question: How does the amount of entry data affects the performance of the algorithms?

In order to answer the question a variety of measurements will be performed to each algorithm, considering the execution time, the assignments on memory, the comparisons performed and the amount of lines of code executed. Then, an exhaustive analysis of the results will also be done with the intention of determining the behavior of the mentioned algorithms and classify them correctly.

#### Abstract 
The motivation behind this project consists of the desire to apply the knowledge acquired in this subject to understand, by comparing the results from different tests, the reasons why is the efficiency of an algorithm and the way it is implemented so important. The purpose of the previously mentioned tests is to analyze the behavior of the chosen algorithms depending on the entry data variability, either in quantity or type. We proceeded by analyzing the Decision Tree and the K-means algorithms in phases with an entry data from a range of 10 to 100000. After running the tests, an evaluation of the results was performed and it was concluded that both algorithms have a linear time complexity and that the amount of entry data affects completely how efficient an algorithm is.
