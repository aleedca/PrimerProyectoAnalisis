#### Introduction
In this project we will study the K-means Unsupervised Algorithm and Decision Tree Supervised Algorithm, mainly focused on their performance. Both of them are Machine Learning algorithms implemented in completely different ways and purposes. This investigation aims to answer these questions: How does the amount of entry data affects the performance of the algorithms? and also, could these algorithms be treatable or non-treatable depending on the amount of entry data?

In order to answer these questions we will perform a variety of analytical and empirical measurements and then do an analysis of the results with the intention of determining the behavior of the mentioned algorithms.

#### Abstract 
The motivation behind this project consists of the desire to apply the knowledge we have acquired in this subject to understand, by comparing the results from different tests, the reasons why is the efficiency of an algorithm and the way it is implemented so important. The purpose of the previously mentioned tests is to analyze the behavior of the chosen algorithms depending on the entry data variability, either in quantity or type. Because of this, we pretend to analyze each algorithm in phases which help our project to know if they are treatable or non-treatable, with an entry data from a range of 10 to 100000.
